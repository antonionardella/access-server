The [STM32MP157C-DK2](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32mp157c-dk2.html) Discovery Kit leverages the capabilities of STM32MP1 Series microprocessors to allow users easily develop [OpenSTLinux](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32-mpu-openstlinux-distribution.html) applications for the ARM Dual Cortex A7 main processor, as well as STM32CubeMP1 software for the Cortex M4 coprocessor.

# OpenSTLinux

The IOTA Foundation and STMicroelectronics have an ongoing cooperation for the STM32Cube expansion software for the industry-leading STM32 32-bit MCU (Cortex-M*) ecosystem, the [X-CUBE-IOTA1](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-iota1.html).

While the [X-CUBE-IOTA1](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/x-cube-iota1.html) toolkit is useful for the M4 coprocessor, weâ€™re going to focus on the **OpenSTLinux** of the Cortex A7.

# PiRelay

For this guide, you should also have a [PiRelay](https://shop.sb-components.co.uk/products/pirelay-relay-board-shield-for-raspberry-pi). Since the STM32MP157C-DK2 has a Raspberry Pi compatible pinout, we should be able to use the PiRelay on the kit without problems.
